# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game with 12 cards. The objective of the game is to find all the matching pairs by clicking on the cards.

Have in mind that this is a beta version, the final version will have a timer, click counter and other difficulty levels.

## How to Play
1. Click on a card to reveal its hidden symbol.

2. Click on another card to reveal its hidden symbol.

3. If the symbols (in this case letters) on both cards match, they will remain visible and you can continue to the next pair.

4. If the symbols on both cards do not match, they will be hidden again and you can try again.

5. Keep playing until you have found all the matching pairs.
